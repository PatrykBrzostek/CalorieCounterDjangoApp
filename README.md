# Calorie Counter App

## Idea
Calorie Counter App is a Django web app, which is based on apps like Fitatu or Yazio. 
Currently the app is still in development mode and provides the basic features: user login, 
adding quick meals to a choosen date and showing all meals and total sum of macronutriens and kcal for choosen date.

Upcoming features and tasks:
- deploying the app
- user registration
- searching and adding meals by ean and name
- showing stats for a given period
